Created the basics (server.js index.html and SQL table) with help from my code over the last couple of days.

next step is fetching the data in my main.js, creating a forEach Loop through each array object and and displaying it on the DOM.

I added my POST route to server.js so it can now recieve new submissions and add them to the SQL table

Added event listener for a submit event from the user which would be stringified so that the server can read it.
